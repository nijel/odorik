Testsuite
---------

The testsuite can be executed using ``py.test``.

Continuous integration
----------------------

We're using several services to ensure our code is healthy:

Travis CI for running the testsuite
    https://travis-ci.org/nijel/odorik
Codeciv for reporting the testsuite coverage
    https://codecov.io/github/nijel/odorik
Landscape for checking quality of our code
    https://landscape.io/github/nijel/odorik/master
